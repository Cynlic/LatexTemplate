# The Sensorial Turn and the Crisis of Methodology 

Unsurprisingly, the question of artistic practice and the process of anthropological research has haunted more than just ethnomusicologists and ethnographers working with the written word. 
Indeed, according to Karen Nakamura, the so-called "crisis of representation" inaugurated by the Writing Culture debates had been traversed almost twenty years earlier among visual anthropologists, with no small degree of anxiety [-@nakamura_making_2013: 133].
In deliniating the various methods of what has been called *sensory ethnography* among socio-cultural and visual anthropologists, Nakamura establishes two forms, both of which confront the question of experience in producing ethnographic work: the *aesthetic-sensual*, which traces its roots to observational cinema, and the *multisensory experimental*, which attempts to center the senses in writing and theoretical orientation [-@nakamura_making_2013: 133-135]. 
Of the two perspectives, the aesthetic-sensual is the most clearly analogous to Slawek's notion of research-based performance as a kind of "experimental translation of a cultural experience," and provides the strongest case for the utility of experiential research forms [-@slawek_study_1994: 22]. 

Nakamura's description of the aesthetic-sensual style of sensory ethnography traces a genealogical path through the history of visual anthropology, begining with the foundation of the Harvard Film Studies Center by Robert Gardner. Gardner's first ethnographic films (Nakamura cites *Dead Birds* as an example) followed standard anthropological and documentarian tradition, utilizing voice-over narration, staged narrative, and other stylistic features facing harsh critique by the observational cinema and *cinema-verite* movements.
