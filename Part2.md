# The Sensorial Turn and the Crisis of Methodology 

Unsurprisingly, the question of artistic practice and the process of anthropological research has haunted more than just ethnographers working with music and the written word. 
Indeed according to Karen Nakamura, the so-called "crisis of representation" inaugurated by *Writing Culture* had been traversed almost twenty years earlier among visual anthropologists, with no small degree of anxiety [-@nakamura_making_2013: 133].
In deliniating the various methods of what has been called *sensory ethnography* among socio-cultural and visual anthropologists, Nakamura establishes two forms, both of which confront the question of experience in producing ethnographic work: the *aesthetic-sensual*, which traces its roots to observational cinema, and the *multisensory experimental*, which attempts to center the senses in writing and theoretical orientation [-@nakamura_making_2013: 133-135]. 
Of the two perspectives, the aesthetic-sensual is the most clearly analogous to Slawek's notion of research-based performance as a kind of "experimental translation of a cultural experience," and provides the strongest case for the utility of experiential research forms [-@slawek_study_1994: 22]. 

Nakamura's description of the aesthetic-sensual style of sensory ethnography traces a genealogical path through the history of visual anthropology, begining with the foundation of the Harvard Film Studies Center by Robert Gardner.
Gardner's first ethnographic films (Nakamura cites *Dead Birds* as an example) followed standard anthropological and documentarian tradition, utilizing voice-over narration, staged narrative, etc., before he developed a style more closely inline with the nascent _Cinéma Vérité_ and observational cinema movements, which prized realism, collaboration, and a reflexive understandings of filmmaker and subject. The substance of this critique was to place film within the role that *Writing Culture* authors would confine writing to -- the production of genre.^[A more substantive description of Cinéma Vérité can be found in the writings of Jean Rouch, particularly "The Camera and Man" in *the Principles of Visual Anthropology* [@rouch_camera_2009].]
In Nakamura's account, Harvard continues to be a hotbed of innovation in the 1990's with the work of Lucien Castaing-Taylor and his foundation of the Harvard Sensory Ethnography lab, which has produced (and continues to produce) a number of films which have rejected the conventions produced in ethnographic film practice, insisting upon a deliberately performative and affect-oriented filmic style. 
Nakamura makes clear the intentions of this filmic school to move both "beyond a discipline of words" and develop a deliberate combination of aesthetic and ethnographic practice, in effect *leaning into* the limitations posed by the form of film itself [-@nakamura_making_2013: 133-134].

The rationale for Castaing-Taylor's turn towards the what Nakamura refers to as the"supratextual" [-@nakamura_making_2013 133] is detailed in his polemical 1996 essay *Iconophobia*, a work which provides a strong theoretical paradigm for the scholarly utility of film's aesthetic (as opposed to strictly pedagogical) potential. 
Castaing-Taylor first outlines typical anthropological objections to filmic representation, best exemplified by Maurice Bloch's notion that films are not "discussive" and therefore bereft of the dialogic context which is the *sine qua non* of ethnographic writing [@taylor_iconophobia:_1996: 66]. 
He critiques these text-first perspectives as an anxiety around the semiotic potential of the filmic image, as it is simultaneously (in Piercian terms) iconic, symbolic, and indexical; this semiotic uniqueness allows for a surfit of interpretations, viewpoints, etc., which both exceed the bounds of the filming ethnographer to control and allow for the production of meaning [@taylor_iconophobia:_1996: 75].
As Castaing-Taylor puts it, 

> In otherwords, if the rules of film resist formulation, this may not be because filmmakers are even more unconscious about the form they manipulate than every day language speakers are about their syntax. It may be that the relative syntactic poverty of the medium is precisely its semantic strength, that which allows it to respond to the diversity and density of human experience as flexibly as it does. [-@taylor_iconophobia:_1996: 86-87]

\noindent Here Castaing-Taylor throws in his lot with precisely the qualities of artistic practice which repeled thinkers in the ethnomusicological canon: film's capacity to speak about a particular topic is not actualized solely in the linguistic realm of symbols, but also in the plane of the sensory, or as Merriam would likely say, feeling.
What is key in this formulation of ethnographic film theory is that it is fundamentally *not* a justification of film as a method; rather, it is a declaration of film's potential *as a statement research itself,* defined as such by its unique ability to respond to and reproduce, in some refracted capacity, human experience. 
This gambit on the unique semiotic qualities of the filmic work sums itself up in Castaing-Taylor's proposition of "thick depiction" as film's counterpart to "thick description," the famous phrase which Geertz adapted from Gilbert Ryle to describe ethnographic writing's ability to layer context on top of context [@geertz_thick_1973: 6].
Implicit in the notion of thick depiction is the suggestion that the potential thickness of sensory experience does not stem from the unique properties of text to remediate events, but rather from hazy relation between aesthetic creation and what I will term here an *ethnographic posture*.
Thus it is a distinct relational position which is the measure of media's ethnographic potential.
