	abstract = {This article poses a straightforward question: What has geography been listening to? Sonic geographies have been established as a relevant subfield in Human Geography in the last decades. During this period, a significant amount of work has been published, but there are still few reviews of these works, and most of them focus solely on Anglophone geography. In this article, I attempt to address this gap by providing an overview of the themes and concepts that have been studied within the emerging subfield of sonic geographies. My intention is to reunite a large range of works that are becoming increasingly scattered and specialized, in order to make sense of the subfield as a whole. With this in mind, I am particularly interested in identifying the “deaf spots” of the subfield, that is, the subjects, concepts, or fields that have not yet been explored thoroughly by sonic geographies.},

	abstract = {Smart cities have begun to garner increasing global popularity and political legitimacy in recent years. Driven largely by corporate interests, smart cities provide highly normative solutions to future urban and economic crises and are now popular in the global north and south alike. Despite a growing critical scholarship on smart cities, the processes and politics through which they manifest in different locations are widely different. Yet, there is a dearth of research on how an understanding of smart cities through the lens of power might contribute to our understanding of contemporary urban theory, citizenship and wider urban transformations. The papers, in this special issue, represent a range of entry points for examining the dynamics of power in the operationalisation of the smart city concept in different contexts. The intention is to examine how smart cities produce and engage power, as a way of normalising the structural and social violence inherent in urban transformations across the world.},

	abstract = {Explores the contemporary politics of Mexican migrant cultural expression manifest in the sounds and poetics of huapango arribeño, a musical genre originating from north-central Mexico. Following the resonance of huapango's improvisational performance within the lives of audiences,musicians, and the author himself - from New Year's festivities in the highlands of Guanajuato, Mexico, to thebackyard get-togethers along the back roads of central Texas - the author shows how Mexicans living on both sidesof the border use expressive culture to construct meaningful communities amid the United States' often vitriolic immigration politics. Through his writing, we gain an intimate look at the experience of migration and how huapango carries the voices of those in Mexico, those undertaking the dangerous trek across the border, and those living in the United States. illuminating how huapango arribeño's performance refigures the sociopolitical and economic terms of migration through aesthetic means, the author adds fresh compelling insightsinto the ways transnational music-making is at the center of everyday Mexican migrant life},
