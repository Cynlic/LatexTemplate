Twitter, a popular microblogging tool has seen a lot of growth since it launched in October, 2006. In this paper, we present our observations of the microblogging phenomena by studying the topological and geographical properties of Twitter's social network. We find that people use microblogging to talk about their daily activities and to seek or share information. Finally, we analyze the user intentions associated at a community level and show how users with similar intentions connect with each other.},

	abstract = {From the foreclosure crisis of 2008, to the tech boom-provoked housing crisis currently engulfing the San Francisco Bay Area, low-income residents of Oakland, California have been displaced from their homes at an alarming rate over the past decade. In this piece I draw from Gloria Anzaldua’s Borderlands and engage with Black geographic thought, urban and sound studies to build a borderlands analytic. I consider how the “tension, ambivalence and unrest” of the borderlands provides a lens to understand the volatility of cities gripped by rapid gentrification. Using a borderlands analytic to make sense of the borders that are produced and policed in gentrifying cities, I consider how Black and Latinx life has been criminalized spatially and sonically so as to be displaced by forces of racial capitalist extraction. To do this, I look to the implementation of gang injunction zones in Oakland in 2010, and then to two moments in 2015 when the city’s soundscapes were policed and criminalized. This piece centers the Black and Latinx geographies experiencing dispossession in Oakland, and considers how residents are imagining and fighting for their city’s future.},

We engage with current geographical work on the question of Blackness, highlighting the ways in which prevailing forms of global capital accumulation—which take shape in numerous spatial and political practices around the world—coincide with acts of anti-Blackness. In recognizing the connections between capitalism and anti-Black violence, however, we choose not to frame anti-Blackness as an effect of capitalist relations. Rather, we insist that anti-Blackness remains a necessary precondition for the perpetuation of capitalism, as the perpetual expansion of capitalist practices requires “empty” spaces open for appropriation—a condition made possible through the modern assumption of Black a-spatiality. Drawing on theoretical discussions of both global capital and anti-Blackness, empirical examples of shifting global spatial-racial regimes, and the discursive and material practices of Black Lives Matter, the Movement for Black Lives, and the Afro-Brazilian community Ilha de Maré, this paper attempts to forge new geographical conversations regarding current capitalist practices and the matter of Black lives.},

	abstract = {This essay elaborates a critical geographical perspective on neoliberalism that emphasizes (a) the path–dependent character of neoliberal reform projects and (b) the strategic role of cities in the contemporary remaking of political–economic space. We begin by presenting the methodological foundations for an approach to the geographies of what we term “actually existing neoliberalism.” In contrast to neoliberal ideology, in which market forces are assumed to operate according to immutable laws no matter where they are “unleashed,” we emphasize the contextual embeddedness of neoliberal restructuring projects insofar as they have been produced within national, regional, and local contexts defined by the legacies of inherited institutional frameworks, policy regimes, regulatory practices, and political struggles. An adequate understanding of actually existing neoliberalism must therefore explore the path–dependent, contextually specific interactions between inherited regulatory landscapes and emergent neoliberal, market–oriented restructuring projects at a broad range of geographical scales. These considerations lead to a conceptualization of contemporary neoliberalization processes as catalysts and expressions of an ongoing creative destruction of political–economic space at multiple geographical scales. While the neoliberal restructuring projects of the last two decades have not established a coherent basis for sustainable capitalist growth, it can be argued that they have nonetheless profoundly reworked the institutional infrastructures upon which Fordist–Keynesian capitalism was grounded. The concept of creative destruction is presented as a useful means for describing the geographically uneven, socially regressive, and politically volatile trajectories of institutional/spatial change that have been crystallizing under these conditions. The essay concludes by discussing the role of urban spaces within the contradictory and chronically unstable geographies of actually existing neoliberalism. Throughout the advanced capitalist world, we suggest, cities have become strategically crucial geographical arenas in which a variety of neoliberal initiatives—along with closely intertwined strategies of crisis displacement and crisis management—have been articulated.},

Amongst other things, this calls for a close reading of the historical and geographical (re)constitution of the process of neoliberalization and of the variable ways in which different “local neoliberalisms” are embedded within wider networks and structures of neoliberalism. The paper’s contribution to this project is to establish a stylized distinction between the destructive and creative moments of the process of neoliberalism—which are characterized in terms of “roll–back” and “roll–out” neoliberalism, respectively—and then to explore some of the ways in which neoliberalism, in its changing forms, is playing a part in the reconstruction of extralocal relations, pressures, and disciplines.},

	abstract = {This paper uses several events in New York in the late 1990s to launch two central arguments about the changing relationship between neoliberal urbanism and so–called globalization. First, much as the neoliberal state becomes a consummate agent of—rather than a regulator of—the market, the new revanchist urbanism that replaces liberal urban policy in cities of the advanced capitalist world increasingly expresses the impulses of capitalist production rather than social reproduction. As globalization bespeaks a rescaling of the global, the scale of the urban is recast. The true global cities may be the rapidly growing metropolitan economies of Asia, Latin America, and (to a lesser extent) Africa, as much as the command centers of Europe, North America and Japan. Second, the process of gentrification, which initially emerged as a sporadic, quaint, and local anomaly in the housing markets of some command–center cities, is now thoroughly generalized as an urban strategy that takes over from liberal urban policy. No longer isolated or restricted to Europe, North America, or Oceania, the impulse behind gentrification is now generalized; its incidence is global, and it is densely connected into the circuits of global capital and cultural circulation. What connects these two arguments is the shift from an urban scale defined according to the conditions of social reproduction to one in which the investment of productive capital holds definitive precedence.},

In this context, this paper offers a reading of urban public space not just as a consumption amenity but also as the “shop floor” of a labor process that goes beyond the walls of the firm to mobilize the social itself in the production of privately appropriated value.

I argue that in the creative class, occupations that exhibit distinctive spatial and political proclivities are bunched together, purely on the basis of educational attainment, and with little demonstrable relationship to creativity. I use a case study of artists, one element of the purported creative class, to probe this phenomenon, demonstrating that the formation, location, urban impact, and politics of this occupation are much more complex and distinctive than has been suggested previously. The spatial distribution of artists is a function of semiautonomous personal migration decisions, local nurturing of artists in dedicated spaces and organizations, and the locus of artist-employing firms. Artists have very high rates of self-employment, boosting regional growth by providing import-substituting consumption activities for residents and through direct export of their work. Their contribution to attracting high-tech activity is ambiguous—causality may work in the opposite direction. Artists play multiple roles in an urban economy—some progressive, some problematic. I argue that artists as a group make important, positive contributions to the diversity and vitality of cities, and their agendas cannot be conflated with neoliberal urban political regimes. I show the potential for artists as a political force to lead in social and urban transformation and the implausibility of their common cause with other members of Florida's ‘creative class’, such as scientists, engineers, managers, and lawyers.},

By focusing on the agency of objects and their ability to challenge our own behaviour in the city, the paper posits a three-stage articulation of subversive creativity; the spark, the spread and ethics.

It argues that digital mapping operates politically through a re-configuration of circulation, power, and territorial formations. Drawing on Stuart Elden’s understanding of territory, where space is ‘rendered’ as a political category, the coming together of digital mapping and the geoweb is uncovered as a political technique re-making territory through computational logics – operating as a calculative practice that, beyond simply representing space, is productive of the political spatiality that characterises territory. The article is based on an analysis of recent attempts by {ICT} corporates, particularly Google, to map favelas in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, critically examining the claim that digitally mapping informal settlements is a mechanism for socio-economic inclusion. Providing a counterargument to claims around the power of digital maps to incorporate favelas, provide recognition, legitimacy, visibility and citizenship, we discuss how in the interface between digital and urban worlds, territory as a political space is constructed through economic incorporation. In doing so, the article unpacks the spatial politics of digital and smart urbanisms and the emerging sovereignties of digital territories, particularly in the context of the tension between inclusion and exclusion experienced by those who live in informal settlements in cities in the global South.},

	abstract = {Explores the contemporary politics of Mexican migrant cultural expression manifest in the sounds and poetics of huapango arribeño, a musical genre originating from north-central Mexico. Following the resonance of huapango's improvisational performance within the lives of audiences,musicians, and the author himself - from New Year's festivities in the highlands of Guanajuato, Mexico, to thebackyard get-togethers along the back roads of central Texas - the author shows how Mexicans living on both sidesof the border use expressive culture to construct meaningful communities amid the United States' often vitriolic immigration politics. Through his writing, we gain an intimate look at the experience of migration and how huapango carries the voices of those in Mexico, those undertaking the dangerous trek across the border, and those living in the United States. illuminating how huapango arribeño's performance refigures the sociopolitical and economic terms of migration through aesthetic means, the author adds fresh compelling insightsinto the ways transnational music-making is at the center of everyday Mexican migrant life},

Piketty?s location within the disciplinary boundaries of academic economics seems to have profoundly shaped his surprisingly apolitical analysis. Engagement with the political dimensions of capital is further constrained to increase the book?s influence upon policy. We analyze important limitations to Piketty?s work that result from these disciplinary constraints. Important politically implicated concepts, problems, and approaches that relate to Piketty?s substantial empirical work are: labor process studies, research on speculative capitalism, and literature highlighting institutional and political determinants among varieties of capitalism.},

A comparison between two books, Dahlhaus's Grundlagen der Musikgeschichte (Foundations of Music History) and Knepler's Geschichte als Weg zum Musikverständnis (History as a Means of Understanding Music), both published in 1977, is instructive as a measure of the two poles of the Methodenstreit: the one centered around music as autonomous work, the other around music as a human activity. The central questions raised prove uncannily current. The two scholars, who knew each other and respected each other's work, were both based in Berlin; but with Dahlhaus in the West and Knepler in the East, they represented the two different political systems that existed in the divided city between 1945 and 1989. In their work, and especially in these two books, Dahlhaus and Knepler defended their own positions and sought to point out weaknesses in the other side. While Dahlhaus's work is well known in English-speaking musicology, Knepler's is not. His contribution to music history and historiography was comparable to Dahlhaus's in importance, however, and his ideas anticipate many tenets of the "new musicology."},

	abstract = {Jazz music is located within the broad aesthetic, political, and theoretical upheavals of our time, to show that modern architecture and urbanism in particular can be strongly influenced and defined by the ways that improvisation is facilitated in jazz. Improvised music consists of diverse properties that fail to register in the object-oriented understanding of composition. As a result, it is often dismissed as noise—an interfering signal. However, such interference can bear meaning and stimulate change. Architecture can respond to the inclusive dynamics of extemporaneous movements, variable conceptions of composition, multiple durations, and wide manipulation of resources found in jazz to enable outcomes that far exceed a design’s seeming potential. The discipline of improvisation continues to open and redefine architectural theory and practice, creating a world where designers contribute to emerging environments rather than make predetermined ones. Modern and avant-garde artists and architects are compared with individuals and groups in jazz—including Piet Mondrian and boogie-woogie, John Cage and Rahsaan Roland Kirk, and Le Corbusier and Louis Armstrong. This reveals how jazz can offer alternative design ideas and directions, be incorporated into contemporary architectural practices, and provide insight on how to develop dynamic metropolitan environments.},

	abstract = {Michel Foucault's concept of genealogy is used in support of two double theories of jazz improvisation. The first is a historical diagnosis: when the notion of the written musical work became the aesthetic paradigm for evaluating music in general, the oral practice of improvisation was marginalized. The second argues that the negative perception of improvisation is related to the sonic forces playing it. All language implies a phonetic code: some sounds are not only accepted but admired, others are dismissed and rejected. Videocentric and graphocentric Western culture holds that a sound can only be known and understood when it is broken down into visual and/or written segments. These theses are supported through analysis of the ontological differences between seeing and hearing, and the cases of John Cage and jazz. The latter, in particular, shows that the fundamental relationship between improvisation and the capacity to exploit the physical music produced by the players' skin, mouth, tongue, lips, torso, arms, and hands to achieve unceasing communion between musicians and audience., En utilisant le concept de généalogie de Michel Foucault, cet article propose deux doubles thèses sur l’improvisation dans le jazz. La première est un diagnostic historique: une fois que la notion d’œuvre musicale écrite est devenue le paradigme esthétique pour évaluer la musique en général, la pratique orale de l’improvisation a été marginalisée. La seconde thèse est que la perception négative de l’improvisation est en relation avec les corps sonores qui la jouent. Tout langage implique un code phonétique: certains sons ne sont pas seulement admis mais aussi admirés, tandis que d’autres sont refusés et rejetés. La culture occidentale vidéocentriste et graphocentriste considère qu’un son ne peut être connu et compris que s’il est décomposé en segments visuels et/ou écrits. Ces thèses sont développées à travers l’analyse des différences ontologiques entre voir et écouter et des cas de John Cage et du jazz. Celui-ci en particulier montre que la relation fondamentale de l’improvisation avec la capacité d’exploiter la musique corporelle produite par la peau, la bouche, la langue, les lèvres, le torse, les bras, les mains des joueurs pour réaliser incessamment une communion entre musiciens et public.},

Beyond unwanted sound is about noise and how we talk about it.

The author draws insights from both classical and recent philosophers (Étienne de La Boétie, Baruch Spinoza, Gabriel Targe, Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, Bruno Latour, Michael Hardt, and Antonio Negri) and from various theorists of musical improvisation (Sun Ra, Derek Bailey, Lawrence 'Butch' Morris, Anthony Braxton, George Lewis, William Parker, and Guerino Mazzola). This inquiry is based on the assumption that improvising musicians have developed a uniquely reflexive awareness about the art of live collaboration, which all of us practice in our daily lives. Jazz musicians represent the intellectual vanguard in the effort to understand the ethical and socio-political implications of the improvisational activities that compose the very fabric of of our common social and political life. On the basis of this assumption, the author narrows and sharpens our definition of improvisation in order to sketch a sharper conception of politics itself, illustrated by the events that revolutionized Tunisia and Egypt in the early months of 2011.},

	abstract = {This article addresses the relationship between light, material culture and social experiences. It argues that understanding light as a powerful social agent, in its relationship with people, things, colours, shininess and places, may facilitate an appreciation of the active social role of luminosity in the practice of day-to-day activities. The article surveys an array of past concep- tions of light within philosophy, natural science and more recent approaches to light in the fields of anthropology and material culture studies. A number of implications are discussed, and by way of three case studies it is argued that light may be used as a tool for exercising social intimacy and inclusion, of shaping moral spaces and hospitality, and orchestrating movement, while working as a metaphor as well as a material agent in these social negotia- tions. The social comprehension of light is a means of understanding social positions in ways that may be real or imagined, but are bound up on the social and cultural associations of certain lightscapes.},

I begin with a review of Florida's argument focusing on the conceptual and theoretical underpinnings. The second section develops a critique of the relationship between the creative class and growth. This is followed by an attempt to clarify the relationship between the concepts of creativity, culture and the creative industries. Finally, I suggest that policy-makers may achieve more successful regeneration outcomes if they attend to the cultural industries as an object that links production and consumption, manufacturing and service. Such a notion is more useful in interpreting and understanding the significant role of cultural production in contemporary cities, and what relation it has to growth.},

	abstract = {This article aims to contribute to the renewal of consideration of media and culture under capitalism, by seeking solid normative foundations for critique via various compatible elements: moral economy, well-being understood as flourishing and Sen and Nussbaum?s capabilities approach. Insufficient attention has been paid to normative and conceptual issues concerning capitalism, media and culture. Moral economy approaches might help fill this gap by valuably providing a richly critical ethics-based approach, drawing on political economy, cultural studies and social theory. Two further concepts, compatible with moral economy, can reinvigorate and renew critique of capitalism, media and culture. The first is a particular (Aristotelian) conception of well-being, understood as flourishing. This is outlined, and its potential contribution to critique of media and culture under capitalism is explicated. The second concept is capabilities, which can provide a basis for dealing with different understandings of flourishing. The article outlines the capabilities approach, analyses rare applications of it to media and culture, and explains how these applications might be built upon, by developing Nussbaum?s work in a way that could ground critique in an understanding of the potential value of media and culture in contributing to people?s flourishing.},

	abstract = {Less a sociology of music than a sociology arising from music. Writers from Michel de Certeau and Louis Marin to to William James and Étienne Souriau inspire other ways of perceiving the constitutive relationships between writing about music and the practice of music than the modes of necessary distancing or personal effusions. Musical experiences (composition, playing, the pleasures of the music-lover) are not simply where music is activated or where an external object is appropriated, they are the very locus of music. Therefore, although writing about these experiences cannot do justice to their process and its perpetual renewal, yet as is true for Certeau and the history of religion, writing helps to make them exist in a different way, to extend them, to supplement them and, conversely, such experiences can underpin writings on the sociology of music. This is illustrated in two examples: an experiment in comparing a text with the personal experience it sought to transcribe: learning how to sing, and an interview with a jazz improviser. The conception of improvisation expressed by the jazz musician is a startling echo of the powerful and original definition of Souriau's work in progress' which is discussed in conclusion. Correlations such as this demonstrate the necessity and the possibility of a sociology of art which, entirely unlike the prevailing scientism, would rank with creative works and, above all, with what they evoke, the worlds whose possibility they reveal. And is this evocation in the work not the province of the sociology of art?, Avec le recul, il me semble que j’ai moins fait de la sociologie de la musique qu’écrit une sociologie depuis la musique. Peut-on, en s’inspirant d’auteurs allant de Michel de Certeau et Louis Marin à William James et Étienne Souriau, reconnaître autrement que sur le mode de la distanciation obligée ou de l’épanchement personnel les rapports constitutifs qu’entretiennent une écriture sur la musique et une pratique de la musique ? Les expériences musicales (la création, le jeu, les plaisirs de l’amateur) sont le lieu même de la musique, elles ne sont pas la mise en oeuvre ou l’appropriation d’un objet extérieur. Dans ces conditions, si la mise par écrit de ces expériences ne peut rendre compte de leur procès, toujours à refaire, en revanche, comme c’est le cas pour l’histoire et la religion chez Certeau, l’écriture contribue à les faire exister autrement, à les prolonger, à les augmenter, tandis que réciproquement, de telles expériences ont soutenu l’écrit du sociologue de la musique que j’ai aussi été. Pour montrer cela, sur deux situations, je rapprocherai à titre expérimental une écriture et l’expérience qu’elle veut transcrire : l’apprentissage du chant – en m’appuyant sur mon propre cas – et un entretien avec un improvisateur de jazz. La conception de l’improvisation que nous livre ce jazzman fait étonnamment écho à la définition puissante et originale de l’« oeuvre à faire » que propose Souriau, sur laquelle conclut ce texte. De telles mises en rapport montrent la nécessité et la possibilité d’une sociologie de l’art qui, loin du scientisme ambiant, se place à la hauteur des oeuvres produites, et surtout de ce à quoi elles appellent, des mondes dont elles disent la possibilité. Cet appel de l’oeuvre ne concernerait-il pas la sociologie de l’art ?},

Enmeshments between ontological thought and qualitative research methodologies have rigorously interrogated the logic of anthropocentrism in conventional humanist research methods and have provoked some scholars to suggest that we can do away with method. Rather than a refusal of methods, we propose that particular (in)tensions need to be immanent to whatever method is used. If the intent of inquiry is to create a different world, to ask what kinds of futures are imaginable, then (in)tensions need attend to the immersion, friction, strain, and quivering unease of doing research differently.},

But this narrative clouds our understanding of the unique ways this music developed in Britain, largely filtered through the {BBC}, as a relatively populist, accessible iteration of Continental techniques. This article explores how British reactions to contemporary music and, in particular, musique concrète and elektronische Musik, reflected on the one hand continued suspicion towards Continental music and on the other a deep insecurity about Britain's musical position in the world. The predominantly hostile attitude towards electronic music from within establishment musical cultures betray profound concerns about trends that were seen to exert a harmful influence on British musical society.},

	abstract = {This article describes a specific history of technological mediation in the circulation of popular music by examining local practices of listening to recordings in Japanese kissaten (often shortened to kissa and meaning, loosely, ‘coffeehouse’). In postwar music kissaten, Japanese listeners were socialised to recordings of foreign music through new modes of hyper-attentive listening. While jazz kissa (though famous as crucibles for radical pro-democracy politics and the explosion of modern urban cool in post-war Japanese cities) encouraged local listeners to develop musical appreciation through the stylistic classification of distant recorded sources, later experimental music kissa helped forge unique local performance scenes by disturbing received modes of generic classification in favour of ‘Noise’. I recount the emergence of a genre called ‘Noise’ in the story of a 1970s Kyoto ‘free’ kissa Drugstore, whose countercultural clientele came to represent ‘Noise’ as a new musical style in its transnational circulation during the 1990s. This ethnographic history presents the music kissa as a complicated translocal site that articulates the cultural marginality of Japanese popular music reception in an uneven global production; but which also helps to develop virtuosic experimental practices of listening through which imported recordings are recontextualised, renamed and recreated.},

We introduce the concept of soundscape as a modality for integrating this work into an anthropological approach. We trace its history as a response to the technological mediations and listening practices emergent in modernity and note its absence in the anthropological literature. We then trace the history of technology that gave rise to anthropological recording practices, film sound techniques, and experimental sound art, noting productive interweavings of these threads. After considering ethnographies that explore relationships between sound, personhood, aesthetics, history, and ideology, we question sound's supposed ephemerality as a reason for the discipline's inattention. We conclude with a call for an anthropology that more seriously engages with its own history as a sounded discipline and moves forward in ways that incorporate the social and cultural sounded world more fully.]},

This article traces three sensory genealogies within anthropology: the work of Ong and {McLuhan} as critiqued and advanced by David Howes and the Concordia Project; phenomenological studies as advanced by Paul Stoller; and a focus on materialities as advanced by Nadia Seremetakis. Studies of individual senses, which we survey, led to calls for a more integrated approach to the senses, both within anthropology and from cinema and media studies. In various ways, the senses are constituted by their imbrication in mediated cultural practices, wheather mediated by technology, discourse, or local epistemologies. We argue that integrating language and discourse into the study of the senses along with new media insights more fully articulates the significance of body-sensorial knowledge.]},

	abstract = {[The cognitive-cultural dimensions of contemporary capitalism are identified by reference to its leading sectors, basic technologies, labor relations systems and market structures. Cognitive-cultural systems of production and work come to ground preeminently in large city regions. This state of affairs is manifest in the diverse clusters of high-technology sectors, service functions, neo-artisanal manufacturing activities and cultural-products industries that are commonly found in these regions. It is also manifest in the formation of a broad stratum of high-skill, cognitive-cultural employees in urban areas. Many of these employees are engaged in distinctive forms of work-based learning, creativity and innovation. At the same time, the cognitive-cultural economy in contemporary cities is invariably complemented by large numbers of low-wage, low-skill jobs, and the individuals drawn into these jobs are often migrants from developing countries. The ideological-cum-political ramifications of this situation are subject to analysis in the context of a critique of the currently fashionable idea of the "creative city." I advance the claim that we need to go beyond advocacies about local economic development that prescribe the deployment of packages of selected amenities as a way of attracting elite workers into given urban areas. Instead, I propose that policy makers should pay more attention to the dynamics of the cognitive-cultural production system as such, and that in the interests of shaping viable urban communities in contemporary capitalism we must be more resolute in attempts to rebuild sociability, solidarity and democratic participation.]},

	abstract = {The soundscape composition, as pioneered at Simon Fraser University since the early 1970s, has evolved rapidly to explore a full range of approaches from the ‘found sound’ representation of acoustic environments through to the incorporation of highly abstracted sonic transformations. The structural approaches similarly range from being analogues of real-world experience, such as listening from a fixed spatial perspective or moving through a connected series of acoustic spaces, to those that mirror both nonlinear mental experiences of memory recall, dreams, and free association, as well as artificial sonic constructs made familiar and possible by modern ‘schizophonic’ audio techniques of sonic layering and embedding. The octophonic surround-sound playback format as used in contemporary soundscape presentations has achieved a remarkable sense of immersion in a recreated or imaginary sonic environment. Specific works realised at {SFU} are analysed that illustrate each of these approaches.},

	abstract = {This article develops a critique of the recently popularized concepts of the ?creative class? and ?creative cities?. The geographic reach and policy salience of these discourses is explained not in terms of their intrinsic merits, which can be challenged on a number of grounds, but as a function of the profoundly neoliberalized urban landscapes across which they have been traveling. For all their performative display of liberal cultural innovation, creativity strategies barely disrupt extant urban-policy orthodoxies, based on interlocal competition, place marketing, property- and market-led development, gentrification and normalized socio-spatial inequality. More than this, these increasingly prevalent strategies extend and recodify entrenched tendencies in neoliberal urban politics, seductively repackaging them in the soft-focus terms of cultural policy. This has the effect of elevating creativity to the status of a new urban imperative ? defining new sites, validating new strategies, placing new subjects and establishing new stakes in the realm of competitive interurban relations. L?article présente une critique des concepts de ?classe créative? et ?villes créatives? publiés récemment. La portée géographique et la pertinence politique de ces discours s?expliquent non par leurs mérites intrinsèques, ceux-ci pouvant être remis en question à plus d?un titre, mais en tant que fonction des paysages urbains fortement néolibéraux qu?ils ont traversés. Quant à leur manifestation concrète de l?innovation culturelle libérale, les stratégies de créativité dérangent à peine les orthodoxies qui subsistent en politique urbaine, fondées sur une compétition interlocale, un marketing de lieu, une expansion axée sur la propriété et le marché, un embourgeoisement et une inégalité socio-spatiale normalisée. Mais surtout, ces stratégies toujours plus présentes prolongent et recodifient des tendances bien installées en politique urbaine néolibérale, les rhabillant de manière attrayante dans un flou artistique terminologique de politique culturelle. Ainsi, la créativité est élevée au statut de nouvel impératif urbain pour définir de nouveaux sites, valider de nouvelles stratégies, positionner de nouveaux sujets et instaurer de nouveaux enjeux dans la concurrence interurbaine.},

	abstract = {Over the last decade and a half, socio-cultural geographies have witnessed a genuine explosion of interest in the ethnographic tradition. Such interest is due in part to the increasing acceptance of non-representational ideas across the field and the way these ideas have constructively informed the long-standing debate on the analytics, esthetics, and politics of ethnographic representation. Non-representational theoretical ideas have influenced the way ethnographers tackle important methodological and conceptual undercurrents in their work, such as vitality, performativity, corporeality, sensuality, and mobility. This article aims to capture a few of the characteristics of this constantly evolving non-representational ethnographic style. Non-representational ethnography seeks to cultivate an affinity for the analysis of events, practices, assemblages, structures of feeling, and the backgrounds of everyday life against which relations unfold in their myriad potentials. Non-representational ethnography emphasizes the fleeting, viscous, lively, embodied, material, more-than-human, precognitive, non-discursive dimensions of spatially and temporally complex lifeworlds.},

	abstract = {In this paper we critically reflect upon the research process underlying an investigation of small venues in Montreal which has brought to the surface the particular ways in which parts of the live music business in Montréal are constituted, organized, and represented. Structured around two anecdotes (Morris, 2006), and inspired by the Foucauldian concepts of population and propinquity (voisinage), the discussion sheds light on an actor whose importance and effectivity in the cultural economy of the city’s live music has yet to be acknowledged: {PLAS} (Petits lieux d’arts et de spectacles).},

	abstract = {A widespread mania for being or becoming a “world city” dominates urban politics today despite the fact that there is no consensus as to what such a thing is. While the economic aspect of a project to build a world city emphasizes capital accumulation, its political–cultural aspect stresses a cosmopolitan ethos and identity in the city. Through the built environment, spectacle and cosmopolitan culture, global capital “sells” a vision of the world city to local political constituencies towards the end of building a class alliance behind the banner of neoliberalism and free trade. This article analyzes the Montreal world city project through a historical study of class relations in the city and the wider political–economic environment since the 1960s. The rise to power of a francophone capitalist class in the 1980s and the defection of Montreal’s urban new middle class from social democracy and Québécois nationalism in the 1960s and 1970s to neoliberalism and cosmopolitanism in the 1980s and beyond are the key developments. The city’s small business and working classes have largely been left holding the bag, paying for cost overruns and industrial incentives, suffering increased air and noise pollution and declining public services, and largely failing to benefit at all from the developing global connectivity.},
